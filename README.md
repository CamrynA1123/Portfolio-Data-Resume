# Portfolio: Data Resume

My data resume reflects my academic and professional experiences, with a specific highlight of data analysis and evaluation skills that I have gained throughout my early career. I created this resume to fulfill the requirements of our "Data Analysis" draft data resume assignment. For this purpose, I was required to prepare a resume that would ideally stand out to a hiring manager seeking candidates with entry level data analysis skills. 

I chose to emphasize my skills in the R programming language and visualization, as well as my relevant graduate coursework. Within my professional and volunteer positons included in this resume, I directed focus toward any work I have done with data and leadership and/or team management.
